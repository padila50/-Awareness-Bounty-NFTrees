# NFTrees
### Problem 
Platforms where NFTs can be generated and then sold to interested parties do not spend much time sharing what is happening in the ecological world.
The fact is that a single piece of art created on such platform consumes gigantic amounts of resources and emits tons of carbon in the atmosphere. 
Forests are being razed and nature is slowly but surely being overwhelmed by the needs of NFTs.

### Idea
This project aims to create awareness among the artists that submit their work on NFT platforms as to how their contribution affects the environment.
This can be achieved through presenting concrete number of trees that are cut down, the amount of coal that is extracted and other critical information
that is not being included in the process of minting a new NFT. However, the information itself is not enough.
This projects aims to also include a fixed fee in each minting transaction. 
This is to be then transferred to a non-profit organization (environmental charity) which is involved in planting trees all around the world.

This information should be presented in a clear way. For instance, 1% of the NFT's price will be used to plant X number of trees.
If the artist wishes to be more generous, they can raise the bar and therefore a higher number of trees can be planted.  
The artists themselves could be incentivised to do that by being part of a special ranking for eco-friendly contributions which would boost their popularity.

There should be at all times a designated section on the corresponding platform that shares statistics regarding the current number of energy consumed
and also share the number of trees that are being planted with each new transaction. The above described approach can be applied similarly to the selling/reselling
of a NFT.
