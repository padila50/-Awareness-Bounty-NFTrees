# NFTrees
Inform the artists that submit their work about how their contribution affects the environment
(e.g. through presenting concrete number of trees that are cut down, the amount of coal that is extracted etc.).
Not only that a fixed fee is to be included in the transaction. 

This should be then redirected to a non-profit organization (aka environmental charity) which is involved in planting trees all around the world.
This information should be presented in a clear way. For instance, 1% of the NFT's price will be used to plant X number of trees.
If the artist wishes to be more generous, they can raise the bar and therefore a higher number of trees can be planted.  

There should be at all times a designated section on the corresponding platform that shares statistics regarding the current number of energy consumed
and also share the number of trees that are being planted with each new transaction.
