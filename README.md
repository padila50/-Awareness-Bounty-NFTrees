# NFTrees
### Problem 
Platforms where NFTs can be generated and then sold to interested parties do not spend much time sharing what is happening in the ecological world.
The fact is that a single piece of art created on such platform consumes gigantic amounts of resources and emits tons of carbon in the atmosphere
is a subject of concern which needs to be addressed sooner rather than later. What can we do against this unreasonable wasting of resources is a
question that has recently been given attention by many concerned individuals and groups. The goal of this project is to bring NFTs one step in the 
right direction which is thinking more about the consequences of even a single NFT on the nature and also about raising the much needed awareness among
artists and traders by applying stricter conditions when one is performing a transaction on a Proof-of-Work blockchain network. 

### Idea
This project aims to create awareness among the artists that submit their work on NFT platforms as to how their contribution affects the environment.
This can be achieved through presenting concrete number of trees that are cut down, the amount of coal that is extracted and other critical information
that is not being included in the process of minting a new NFT. However, the information itself is not enough.
This projects aims to also include a fixed fee in each minting transaction. This is to be then transferred to an authorized non-profit organization
(environmental charity) which is involved in planting trees all around the world. That way the large energy consumption that comes with the creation of a new
digital asset will be in fact be taken into account and the right counter measures will be applied.

This information should be presented in a clear way. For instance, one should choose to donate at least 0.001 eth during the process of minting a new collectible
and also the NPO (non-profit-organization) which will be the recipient of the fee.
If the artist wishes to be more generous, they can raise the bar and therefore a higher number of trees can be planted.
The artists themselves could be incentivised to do that as each NFT will receive a "green" rank based
on the fee that the artist is willing to provide to a authorized non-profit organization. Based on that fee the artists will receive 
"green" tokens where these would serve as a way to vote on which the authorized NPOs will be, meaning allowing the owners to take part in governance decisions.
The owners of these tokens could receive other bonuses such as the right to have their NFT listed in a special section to receive even more attention and therefore be easier to sell.

The workflow described during the minting process can be applied to the trading of a NFT as well. With each trading artists will have to provide again the same
fee and with the same condition that if they are willing to pay a larger one, they will in turn receive more of the "green" tokens.
